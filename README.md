Santiago Valdarrama's 3rd problem that "every Software Engineer should be able to solve. Here are the directions:
1) Write a function called fib() that returns an array containing the first 50 Fibonacci numbers.
2) numsToStrings() for new array of strings
3) numEvenNums() function that returns a number of even numbers in the array.
